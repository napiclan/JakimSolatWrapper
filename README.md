An Objective-C class for pulling and parsing prayer times from JAKIM e-Solat Portal. Simple and clean implementation that reads the following information from the web:

## Setting up the wrapper

You need to add libxml2.dylib to your project.

Go to the Project build settings (Project->Edit Project Settings->Build) and find the "Search Paths". In "Header Search Paths" add the following path:

	/usr/include/libxml2
